In the\n","Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left\n","(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch\n","directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped\n","on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right.
